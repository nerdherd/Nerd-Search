# Nerd Search Scouting App Charged Up 2023

Scouting app in development aimed to reduce the effort needed to scout during matches (because lets be honest - no one likes to scout).  
Created using ReactJS, haven't figured out the backend yet.  
We hope to have bluealliance API integration as well as features to make it easier for not just the scouters but the strategy team as well.  
Goal is to make the app easily adaptable to future games.
